# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Django

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace running Django! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Django.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

To run this application:

```python
python manage.py runserver
```

Okay so this is beautiful, this is what I'm starting with right here. 

This is going to be the rest API, I should pull up rest framework documentation.


Okay, so a bit of a mess throughout the project, got a lot of things going here, might want to cut down a bit. Not sure I'm going to need celery for anything yet, but actually I think that was a good call and I should stick with it. 

I can actually knock this out now, I just need to go back in, check in on the bunk thing, and then get rolling with my plans, I can refer to everything in the documentation (trello) and also should bring up a chatgpt window.
